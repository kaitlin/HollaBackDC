Byteflow documentation
======================

.. rubric:: Everything you want to know about Byteflow.

What's that
-----------

Byteflow is a blog engine, written on `Python`_, using `Django`_. Why should you choose it over competitors? It has very clean codebase and developers, which are struggling to keep it so (that ease learning code and adding features for python programmers and those who sympathize ;). It has a lot of cool features, which you can't get in other blog engines or will get with difficulty (consider feed by union of tags, eh?). And of course it is actively developed so release are not that far away.
