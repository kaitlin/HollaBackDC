How to use Mercurial for contribution
=====================================

Basics
------

Mercurial is a distributed VCS [#f1]_, which means that every repository copy
contains all changes of data, unlike centralized VCS (Subversion, CVS). This may
sound scaring but whole history (over 1k revisions) of Byteflow (with working
copy) takes only 14% more space than a working copy of Subversion. This gives
you ability to very fast checking of what's going on, using ``log``,
``annotate``, etc.

Also this means that two guys, sitting far away one from another, can
simultaneously commit two different revisions to same repository (I mean it
contains same history, but every guy has his own copy of a repository). This is
absolutely normal situation, but this means that changeset history in Mercurial
is not linear: as two different changesets can be committed on top of same
changeset, then we got directed acyclic graph.

In human language it is called "tree": root changeset and its descendants. Each
descendant can have one or two (then it is a merge) and zero (then it's a head)
or more children. Merges [#f2]_ are special changesets which merge (naturally
;-) two branches of a changeset tree into single one. Heads are changesets which
does not have children. When there is more than one head, then repository
probably needs a merge. There is always head which is tagged with special tag
"tip", which means that this is latest changeset.

How to send patches
-------------------

Before doing anything you should slightly configure Mercurial. Its config is
stored in ``~/.hgrc`` on \*nix and in ``%APPDATA%\Mercurial.ini`` on Windows.

This is sample configuration that you might use as base for yours::

  [ui]
  username = Some Guy <someguy@example.com>

  [diff]
  git = 1

  [extensions]
  hgext.patchbomb=

  [email]
  method = sendmail

Or if your want to use SMTP::

  [email]
  method = smtp

  [smtp]
  host = your.smtp.server
  username = username
  password = password

After that it's easy to send your changesets for review and applying::

  hg email -r REV # send particular changeset
  hg email -o     # send all changesets that are not in destination repository

You can also read ``hg help email`` if you want more information about
options. Where to send patches? Preferred address is
byteflow-hackers@googlegroups.com.
